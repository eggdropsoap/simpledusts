SimpleDusts
===========

Dust recipes compatible with SimpleOres 2.

Currently requires some other mod with a grinder that will look for ore-to-dust recipes
and automatically add them to the grinder. (One example is the quartz grindstone from
Applied Energistics.)

Also adds a shapeless 3 copper dust + 1 tin dust recipe to get 4 bronze dust.
